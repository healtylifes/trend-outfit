<p>Floral shoes made in collaboration with marimekko. The narrow construction is the major cause of this minimal toe room. Most of the complaints with the original 350 boost were that it was too large, so it might be that adidas is still perfecting the fit on this one. I see one reviewer said just the opposite, noting they had a lot of room in the toe box area, but i have been wearing wide shoes for years and the ultraboost are definitely too.
