<p>Thank you for your business. I personally don�t wear nike shoes to run, so i bought the neat little shoe pouch by grantwood technology. The product allows nike+ipod sport kit owners to use the wireless pedometer system with shoes other than the nike+ shoes that have an insert for the transmitter.

<p>Thank you for your business. We stock audio head phones, sound equipment as well as iphone accessories. The colors (except clear) match those of the shoe pouch, another product from grantwood technology that allows runners and walkers to attach the sensor from the nike+ipod sport kit to the outside of their favorite shoe. The silicone skin is secure, thick and protective and allows access to all the ports on the iphone 4, with a custom fit and proper openings.
