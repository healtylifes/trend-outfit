Over the past few months, i’ve been experimenting with fixing our shoes as they’ve worn out, and i’ve found two quick fixes that really work. Mine are always destroyed in 2 months too. Do you still wear shoes inside? Prepare to be seriously.</p>

<p>If it is worn out your heel could be sliding around more than it needs to and causing your foot to be more unstable. So this generally means that whether you are running or walking, your foot applies more pressure to the outside of your feet. Over the past few months, i’ve been experimenting with fixing our shoes as they’ve worn out, and i’ve found two quick fixes that really work. They have about 1cm thick sole made of some sort of solid rubber thing (not sure of what it is sorry) which got thin and worn out at the front mostly and at the heel a bit. The uneven wear on the sole of my shoe mildlyinteresting.</p>
