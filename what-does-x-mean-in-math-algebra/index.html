<p>A variable is a letter whose value is unknown to us. In math xx means x such that x in set builder notation. It is called a variable or sometimes an unknown. The letter x is often used in algebra to mean a value that is not yet known. In other words x is one of the objects in the collection of possibly many objects in the set A.</p>
