<p>For this to happen, you’d have to have a friction situation where your sock remains in close contact and basically stuck to your skin with high friction levels. Pay attention to those shoes wearing out more on the outside! If kami or someone else were to do the same they would be wearing somewhere else more than likely. If you are wearing boots you will now use the leather loop on the back of the boot to attach the boot hook. Can a cobbler fix this wear inside the heel of my boots.</p>
