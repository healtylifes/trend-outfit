<p>Look for signs of wear along the outside edge of your shoe. If you have purchased a pair of shoes that do not fit or are the wrong type, you should not hesitate to return them. You should have at least a thumb width between the end of your longest toe and the end of the shoe ideally for running. The dampening of the socks shows that the shoes are too tight and do not provide space for ventilation. Where To Recycle Running Shoes.</p>
