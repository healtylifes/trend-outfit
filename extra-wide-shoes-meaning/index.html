<p>A wide width is 1/4” wider than a medium width and an extra wide width is 1/2” wider than a medium width. Extra wide fit is determined by a combination of the two, so feet with the same circumference can be classified into different wide fit sizes depending on shoe size. For men, a 2e is considered a wide shoe, while a 4e or larger will be considered extra wide. Among them, shoe width d stands for medium sized shoes for men while shoe width b stands for medium sized shoes for women. Difference Between Wide and Medium Shoes Difference Between.</p>
