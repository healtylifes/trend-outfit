<p>Less than a year later, one of the most polarizing events that can impact a shoe’s value occurred: By the time the 1980s rolled around, it was up to nike to think of new, creative ways to expand upon their success.

That total accounted for about eight percent of the apparel giant’s overall sales. How many shoes does Nike sell a year? ShoesOps.</p>
