<p><strong>How Does Friction Affect Shoes</strong>, When the irregularities of our shoe and the surface caught up it causes the shoe wear and tear and also because of the heat produced by frictional force causes wear and tear. This applies in the case of the shoe. Friction is the force that counteracts a shoe and surface sliding past each other, caused by the surfaces rubbing against each other. A flat sole or a polished floor will generally reduce the friction between shoe and floor as the flat surfaces slide past each other more easily.</p>

<p>Fluid friction doesn�t sound like something that would have to do with basketball, but it does. Friction prevents the soles of your shoes from slipping over the ground. For example, football in which sliding maneuvers are common and clothing does not fully cover the limbs. The shoe friction experiment helps children do an activity that has a practical application.</p>

<p>This has been shown between our types of shoes we have learned that between skateboarding, basketball, and futsal shoes. There are two types of friction, static friction, sliding. Fluid friction is air resistance, and it effects your shot. The force of friction between sole and ground provides the necessary grip which pushes us forward. Diagrams and Friction.</p>
