<p><strong>Do You Need Bigger Shoes For Orthotics</strong>, When you are being fitted for orthotics, it is important to take the footwear you will be wearing them in to your pedorthic appointment so your pedorthist can take the style into account during the design and manufacturing stage.

So, you would start not using the orthotic for shorter runs first. If your shoes are already a tight fit, the next half size might be a good idea.</p>
