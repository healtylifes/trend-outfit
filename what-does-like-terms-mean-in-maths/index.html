<p><strong>What Does Like Terms Mean In Maths</strong>, Like terms are combined in algebraic expression so that the result of the expression can be calculated with ease. In other words terms that are like each other. The only difference between like terms are the coefficients. Like terms are terms whose variables and their exponents such as the 2 in x 2 are the same.</p>
