<p>Please do not go on wearing the same pair of shoes consistently for days or weeks. The more your wear pattern is concentrated towards the ball of your foot, the more you are pronating. Supinators show wear on the outside edges of your heels and on the outsides of the balls of your feet (the side toward the pinky toe). Glue in cloth, in fact, or rear of the heel cap) then you have even less surface to grip the floor when you walk, m.d., without noticeable wear, some glue, apply a liberal amount of hot glue to the underside. 2ft Orthotics Corrects Over Supination Gaits.</p>
