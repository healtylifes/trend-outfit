<p>If you are someone running lots of miles (think training for a half or full marathon), consider having two pairs of shoes of varying weights. If you start using adidas running now or are already tracking your runs with it, in the future, you will know how many kilometers you have on your shoes. Obviously if you’re a seasoned runner or professional that heads out on a long run each day, then this can mean you’re in need of a new pair of shoes much. I normally wear a 7.5 but usually its very snug. How much room should I allow for growth in my kids shoes.</p>
