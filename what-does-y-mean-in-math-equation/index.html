<p>Now you are to solve it and find y but u dont have enough information about the other variable ie. A formula is a mathematical rule or relationship that uses letters to represent amounts which can be changed these are called variablesFormulae contain equals signs as do equations so it can sometimes be difficult to tell the difference between an equation and a formula. Occasionally the above is called a linear equation of two variables where y and x are the variables. Answer 1 of 5. Where k is the constant of variation.</p>
