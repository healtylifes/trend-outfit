<p>This procedure has a lower risk of complications but it does increase the risk of dehydration. There are options that can decrease the likelihood of a colostomy in this case. It involves washing out your colon with water either every day or every other day. Depending on the reason for your colostomy you may be able to perform colostomy irrigation as an alternative to wearing a bag. Pin On Heha Therapy Centre.</p>

<p>This means you wont have to wear a colostomy bag but it can be time-consuming. Any advice would be appreciated. To do this you gently insert a small device into your stoma and attach it to a bag full of water. Has anyone had this done or any other alternatives. Pin On Rusty.</p>
