<p>If we take this number for good, this means that 27,435 at a $9 per unit, the cost to toms was $236,915. Most shoes are shipped by ocean freight. So if a pair of shoes costs $150 in the store, nike sold them at wholesale to the store for about $75, and nike�s landed cost was roughly $37.50. As the consumer, it’s their right to pay as much or as little as they want for whatever they choose. This is how much it costs Nike to make a pair of 100.</p>
