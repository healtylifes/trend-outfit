<p>The cout object in C is an object of class ostream. So the members of the std namespace are cout cin endl etc. It is associated with the standard C output stream stdout. When you send something to cout or any other output stream it does not process and output the data immediately. Inserts a newline character into the output sequence os and flushes it as if by calling osputoswidenn followed by osflush.</p>

<p>The endl is used to create new lines but it does not send to the new line only after sending the cursor to the next line it flushes the buffer each time. After the cout object is constructed it is tied to cin which means that any input operation on cin. Both endl and n serve the same purpose in C they insert a new line.
