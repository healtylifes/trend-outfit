<p>You should consider replacing your running shoes if you constantly need to adjust the laces to be tighter or to open them up, if your toes go numb or are chafing or if you develop hot spots or sore spots on your foot. This type of shoe will prevent you from rolling in too far. Then you can find the correct size of the shoes that you would like to buy, by looking in the column with the cm measurement found in your shoes. Best for running on dirt and rocky trails.
