<p>The probability of getting Sam is 06 so the probability of Alex must be 04 together the probability is 1 Now if you get Sam there is 05 probability of being Goalie and 05 of not being Goalie. Is the ratio between the circumference and diameter of a circle. The probability of an event is a number between 0 and 1 where roughly speaking 0 indicates impossibility of the event and 1 indicates certainty. EX is the expectation value of the continuous random variable X.</p>
