<p>Rutishauser fromthe medicalresearch council infantile malnutrition unit, mulagohospital, kampala, uganda investigators have studied the relation between height and the length of various long bones (dupertius andhadden, 1951; The longitudinal series of 242 girls and 104 boys were analysed for the age of the peak increase in shoe size, as well as the age of cessation of foot growth based on shoe size.
