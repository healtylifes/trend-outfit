<p>Being barefoot could cause your foot to slip off the gas or brake. In canada, it is illegal to leave your horse in front of the country squire without hitching it securely to the hitching post. Penalties vary state to state in the u.s., and usually aren’t quite so severe, but are. Contrary to common belief, it is not illegal to drive a car while barefooted in any state in the united states.
