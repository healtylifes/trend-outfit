<p>As the fashion industry and consumers have embraced the many styles of toms shoes, “shoe drops” organized by the company in argentina, ethiopia and south africa have. What makes toms shoes unique is each time someone purchases a pair of toms shoes, the company donates a pair to a child in need. It isn’t about the profits, it is about making a sustainable project that goes beyond you and your customers. For every pair of toms shoes people like you and me purchase at nordstrom or one of their other retail outlets, toms gives a pair of shoes to a needy child in a developing country, 20 million. TOMS With every pair you purchase, TOMS will give a pair.</p>
