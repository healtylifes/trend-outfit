<p>The measurement you take, in inches or centimetres, is the correct height of that heel. A heel’s height is the measurement from the heel cap, or bottom, up to the sole of the shoe itself. This is something i didn�t know about before shoes of prey so i thought i�d make a quick video showing not only how to measure heel height, but also why heel. Larger size sandals will have a relatively higher heel and lower size sandals will have a relatively lower heel, proportionately. Heel Chart.</p>
