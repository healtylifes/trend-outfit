<p>To get “out” of the pedals, twist your heel away from the bike frame to release the cleat. I live in the northeast and while roads are pretty well plowed of snow on most occasions, sidewalks and parking lots are hit and miss.

How tight should spd pedals be? 2018 Specialized Women�s 2FO Flat 1.0 Mountain Bike Shoes.</p>
